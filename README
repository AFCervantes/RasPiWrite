RasPiWrite
by Matt Jump
####################
About:
RasPiWrite is a simple and easily modifiable python script that automates the process of mounting, downloading and installing a Raspberry Pi Distro, currently the script is 
only compatiable with Mac OSX systems, mostly because currently Macs have no easy way of installing Raspberry Pi distros, however I will try and make the script universal for all 
unix systems as soon as I can.

Install:
unzip: 'unzip RaspiWrite.zip'
chmod +x raspiwrite.py
sudo ./raspiwrite.py (or run as root)

So...What can I do?
RasPiWrite supports all the distros currently on the Official Raspberry Pi downloads page, the script will choose a mirror at random to help ease the pressure on the mirror 
network.

Warning - 
Please bear in mind that this software is very much in Beta, if you don't follow all instructions provided, you may screw something up majorly!
